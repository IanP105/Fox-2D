# Fox-2D

## Overview
This is a simple 2D-platformer style game made with the Unity engine.  It consists of three levels and is complete with movement mechanics and level progression.  The game has a title screen, level selection menu, options menu, and pause menu.  Each level has a different set of obstacles, different appearance, and different background music.  The goal of the game is to reach the end of each level by using the movement mechanics provided.  This includes moving from side to side, jumping, and crouching.

This game was created in one school semester as part of a graduate-level software engineering project.  The full project report can be found in the file named "CSC-550 Group Project [D5 REVISION].pdf" in the root of this repo.  It contains documentation, reporting, testing, and more.
